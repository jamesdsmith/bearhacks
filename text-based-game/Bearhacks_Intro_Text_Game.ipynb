Way back when before the Graphical User Interfaces that we have now, users interacted with the computer using command-line interfaces (such as Terminal). While we mostly use GUIs today, the command-line allows us to be very direct and specific when interacting with the computer.\n",

When installing, be sure to check \"Use Windows' default console window\".\n",

If you have a .py python file in the current directory, you can type `python file.py` to run the file. Note that print statements will print out into the current terminal console. To go back from the current directory, you can type `cd ..` to go back one folder, or type `cd` to go back to your home directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to directly write and execute python code, you can type just `python` which will then change the command prompt to look like `>>>`.
