  output. However this time we will need to change the frequency of the square
  wave in order to change the tone generated. In order to do this we will use
  the tone() function. The function generates a square wave at a certain 
  frequency. Now we need to keep to keep track of the current frequency.
  Each iteration of the loop, we will set the buzzer to a certain frequency and
  wait for a few hundred milliseconds. Finally this loop will be repeated by the
  loop function while the MSP is on. */
