  //First lets create an integer variable called curr_freq and initialize it 
  //with the value of 440. 
  //A variable is declared using the following format: 
  //int [variable name] = [Initial value]
  
  //Your code here:
  
  
  //Now let's create a variable to read the input from the photocell. Lets call
  //this variable light_in and set it to zero.

  //Your code here:
  
  
  //Now read the input from the photocell and put it in light_in

  //Your code here:


  //analogRead() returns a number between 0 and 1023. We need to scale this number to
  //half that range, then add it to the base frequency of 440Hz. Set curr_freq to 
  //this value

  //Your code here:


  //Finally let's write this tone to the output and delay for a few hundred milliseconds

  //Your code here:
